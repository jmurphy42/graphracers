# Graphracers

Graph Racers is an Angular app for the paper and pencil game [Racetrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racetrack_%28game%29). It was developed as a proof of concept and for practice with Angular and a canvas-based game. There are undoubtedly many ways to cheat the logic, so just be honest and have fun.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
